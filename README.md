Barracuda PHP Code Standards
============================

The Barracuda coding standards follow PSR-1 and PSR-2 standards closely with a few specific exceptions and additions.  These exceptions and additions have been agreed upon by a working group of leaders within each of the teams that use PHP.

INSTALLATION
------------

1. Install [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer#installation)

2. Install your editor plugin.
 - For Sublime Text, this is `Phpcs` in Package Control.
 - For Atom, install `linter` and `linter-phpcs`

SETUP
-----

When running `phpcs` or `phpcbf` point it to the location where you cloned this repo with the `--standard=/path/to/this/repo/PHP_CodeSniffer/Barracuda/ruleset.xml`

Below are some sample configurations for various editors:

### Sublime Text 2 & 3
There is an example .sublime-project file for Sublime Text in the config directory. You'll need to rename it to .sublime-project and place it in your repo directories.

	{
		"phpcs_additional_args": {

		 	// self-explanatory
			"--standard": "/absolute/path/to/commonstandards/Barracuda/ruleset.xml",

			// this allows us to continue to use tabs (part of our standard)
			"--tab-width": "4",

			// this silences notices and yells only about important stuff
			"-n": ""
		},

		// self-explanatory
		"phpcs_executable_path": "/absolute/path/to/phpcs"
	}

### Atom
For Atom, the following configuration should be added to ~/.atom/Config.cson. It can also be configured in the `linter-phpcs` settings page.

	"linter-phpcs":
	    codeStandardOrConfigFile: "/absolute/path/to/commonstandards/Barracuda/ruleset.xml"
	    executablePath: "/absolute/path/to/phpcs"
	    tabWidth: 4
	    warningSeverity: 0

### vim
It is suggested to use [Syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic) for vim.
This supports phpcs for php checking as well as many other languages
The following config should do php linting as well as code sniffing

	" Use the following for checking php files
	let g:syntastic_php_checkers = ['php', 'phpcs']
	" Aggregate all the errors together
	let g:syntastic_aggregate_errors = 1
	" Set phpcs args
	let g:syntastic_php_phpcs_args="--standard=/path/to/common-standards/Barracuda"

----
- require newline or opening brace before // comments
- require $underscored_variable_names
- require no brace-contained else clauses in inline IFs
- disallow "naked $vars in text" (require braces)
